Problem Statement : For a given dataset (problem) which is the best classification algorithm (as per accuracy)

Pick up a dataset of your choice or the one attached with mail (Preferable) 

Ask any two questions on the dataset of your choice and provide answers for the same. 

For instance for the given dataset questions can be as follows.

Q1) What are the most common emotions/words used by Males and Females?
Q2) Which gender makes more typos in their tweets?

Take up three classification algorithms of your own choice and build three respective Machine learning models. Compare the Accuracy of all three and suggest which ML algorithms suits best for the given problem.

NOTE  : For the given dataset "Gender" will be your dependent variable.
